          "question": "What is the advantage of QR codes?",
          "answer": "As well as providing an anonymous way of reporting a situation, the codes also act as a direct bridge to people trained to deal with critical situations and assist those affected. Visitors do not have to approach strangers in the hope of not overwhelming them and receiving the appropriate response. In addition, unlike other approaches, visitors do not have to download an app or provide a large amount of personal information."

        {
          "question": "Can I also use saferspaces for one-time events?",
          "answer": "Saferspaces can be used for one-time events as well as permanently. Its straightforward and focused approach means that little preparation is required to set up the infrastructure, even at short notice. To ensure that trained personnel are available to deal with potential incidents on-site, we can also assist with the provision of suitable awareness personnel."
        },
        {
          "question": "What costs will I incur as the organiser?",
          "answer": "Costs are based on the maximum capacity of the venue. There is also a one-off set-up fee, which is used to test the set-up with the relevant personnel, to answer any final questions and to ensure that trained personnel are available to deal with any incidents and to assist those affected."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the advantage of QR codes?",
          "answer": "In addition to providing your guests with an easy way to contact the awareness team, the codes offer several key advantages. According to initial reports, their very presence in the venue, together with descriptions of their function, has already had a positive effect on the atmosphere among visitors. Visitors recognise a comprehensive security concept, and opportunists are deterred from potential misconduct. Furthermore, the QR codes offer the advantage that guests only need a mobile device to benefit from the concept; there is no need to download a separate app. In addition, no location information is required from the guests to locate the offenders or observers, as each code stores its own unique location, which is transmitted to the team when scanned."
        },
        {
          "question": "What kind of infrastructure do I need to provide saferspaces?",
          "answer": "The most important requirement is reliable internet coverage to ensure that scans reliably reach the awareness team. Depending on this, as providers of saferspaces, you only need a tablet (recommended) or phone to coordinate incoming cases. In addition to the application, we are happy to assist you with the infrastructure and provision of hardware. The whole system consists of three components: Administration, where the codes for the event are generated and the desired features (chat, location sharing, emergency number, etc.) can be configured. An application for the awareness teams, where incidents are received and coordinated. Codes for visitors and staff to report unsafe situations. In addition to the technology, it is vital that the people handling the incidents are trained to deal with the people involved. If training is required or desired in this area, we can put you in touch with the appropriate initiatives."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I ensure that the messages are actually seen by staff?",
          "answer": "It is important that at least one person remains near the device that displays incoming cases. When someone scans a code, the screen will flash and an alarm will sound for one minute or until the case is acknowledged."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can I be sure that the codes are not being misused?",
          "answer": "From our previous deployments, we are pleased to report that there have been no instances of misuse regarding the codes. This success can be attributed to the descriptions on the signs and the specific steps within the application. For example, after scanning, individuals are asked to specify whether they are an observer or someone affected. We also recommend a brief introduction at the entrance, emphasizing the desire for respectful behavior and outlining possible consequences, such as being banned, for not adhering to the rules."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can staff also use the codes if they need support? ",
          "answer": "It's actually an important part of our approach because many eyes can better ensure the well-being of everyone present. Staff have the option to request assistance, both for their own cases of uncertain situations and for situations they observe. There's the option to scan in before the start of the shift and then just press a button to request help. Staff can also call for help in two ways. Firstly, they can report an unsafe situation so that someone can come to help. Secondly, there's an emergency button for situations where not only the awareness team but also the security staff need to come to help."
